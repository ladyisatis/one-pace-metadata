      One Pace is a fan project that recuts the *One Piece* anime in an endeavor
      to bring it more in line with the pacing of the original manga by Eiichiro Oda.
      The team accomplishes this by removing filler scenes not present in the source material,
      fixing animation errors and correcting subtitles.'
